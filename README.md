Fix VHD/VHDX permissions when moving virtual machine data from one host to another

When moving virtual machine data from one host machine to another, you can sometimes end up
with permission issues when trying to start your VM's back up. This tool helps speed the process
up by displaying a list of VM's on the current host machine, and adds permissions for the selected
VM account to the desired VHD/VHDX file.
